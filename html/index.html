                <p>I first went to a convention in Denver, CO. I've never been here before, but they call it the mile high city. It was fun. I saw fire works in "civic park." There is a street mall that has buses. And fortunately ComicCon was there too. I took a peek.</p>
                <img src="../images/red_rock_amp.jpg">
                <p>I also visited the natural ampatheater created out of red rock. They call it Red Rock. It's huge and beautiful.</p>
                <img src="../images/vail_vill.jpg">
                <p>Finally, I took a side trip to Vail. This quaint small swiss villge was a delight to walk. Human scale, pedestrain friendly. And I took to tram up the mountian for a birds-eye view. Carefull, you will get dizzy at such a high altitude without the oxygen levels so thin.</p>

                <p>I went to my cousin's wedding. Which was in her backyard. This neighborhood was so beautiful with all the vegetable gardens people plant in front of their homes. I picked wild strawberries.</p>
                <img src="../images/green_lake.jpg"><img src="../images/garden_sidewalk.jpg">
                <p>I also walked around this huge lake. It was buzzing with activity even late into the night, because the sun sets so late. I saw a milk-carton boat race.</p>
